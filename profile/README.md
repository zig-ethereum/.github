Zig is an exciting new language focused on simplicity and robustness, ideals that we should
always strive towards especially when building decentralized networks. This organization is
dedicated to bringing the ethos of Zig to Ethereum, making it simpler to maintain and build
software on top of our global computer.

## Learn Ethereum

There are many invaluable resources for learning how the fundamentals of Ethereum work, but
nothing is more valuable than reading and understanding the main protocol through it's
implementations. Our Zig node implementation is based on the many greats before us:

- https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs
- https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs
- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
- https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse
- https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth

All `zig-ethereum` code is focused on being the most well-documented resource on Ethereum so
reading the code documentation should feel like reading the manual on Ethereum. Get started
by taking a look at [`zeth`](https://github/zig-ethereum/zig).
