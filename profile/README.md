Zig is an exciting new language focused on simplicity and robustness, ideals that we should
always strive towards, especially when building decentralized systems. This organization is
dedicated to bringing the ethos of Zig to Ethereum, making it simpler to maintain and build
software on top of our global computer.

## Learn Ethereum

There are many invaluable resources for learning how the fundamentals of Ethereum work, but
nothing is more valuable than reading and understanding the main protocol through its
implementations. Our Zig node implementation is based on the many greats before us:

- [ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
- [ledgerwatch/erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon)
- [akula-bft/akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula)
- [paradigmxyz/reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)
- [sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)
- [ethereum/execution-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs)
- [ethereum/consensus-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs)

We're focused on being the most well-documented resource on the Ethereum protocol. Reading
the code and documentation should feel like reading a (friendly) manual on Ethereum. Our
first project [zeth](https://github.com/zig-ethereum/zeth) is an Ethereum execution (and
eventually consensus) client implemented in pure Zig with no external dependenices. It's
currently in a private repository but will be open-sourced well before its initial release.
It's written slowly and with care trying to think through exactly what an Ethereum client
could be.

optimal and reusable software."_
